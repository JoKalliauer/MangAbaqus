# MangAbaqus

Prof. Mang's Project using Abaqus-FEM, originally created by Michał Malendowski (©2019-2020) and extended and rebuilt by Johannes Kalliauer (©2020-2022).

This code was published in Aug. 2022 under GNU AGPLv3 for the paper _Conditions for minimum stiffness of proportionally loaded structures_ .

To start call Main_*.m
- eccentric Compression:  Main_ecc.m
- Bending: Main_bend.m
- Stützlinienbogen: Mail_TLArch.m
- Cantilever: Main_canti.m

This code was used the following publiations
- [On a remarkable geometric-mechanical synergism based on a novel linear eigenvalue problem](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00707-021-03091-5)
- [Are the terms stiffening/softening structures mechanically unambiguous?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euromechsol.2022.104756)
- Conditions for minimum stiffness of proportionally loaded structures (under Review)

This projects were financial supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) in the framework of the research project P 31617-N32 [Pseudo-kinematic invariants - gems in FE structural analyses].
